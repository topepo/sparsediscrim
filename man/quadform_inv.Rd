\title{Quadratic Form of the inverse of a matrix and a vector}
\usage{
quadform_inv(A, x)
}
\arguments{
\item{A}{matrix that is p x p and nonsingular}

\item{x}{vector of length p}
}
\value{
scalar value

\description{
We compute the quadratic form of a vector and the inverse of a matrix in an
efficient manner. Let `x` be a real vector of length `p`, and let
`A` be a p x p nonsingular matrix. Then, we compute the quadratic form
\eqn{q = x' A^{-1} x}.
}
\details{
A naive way to compute the quadratic form is to explicitly write
`t(x) \%*\% solve(A) \%*\% x`, but for large `p`, this operation is
inefficient. We provide a more efficient method below.

Note that we have adapted the code from:
